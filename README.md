## Explanation

It is a utility for writers.
Anyone can use it for making new names of fictional characters and places.
Do, what You want.

## How to run

How to run?
Download this repository and run (in console) the random_word.py file.
You can also run the random_text.py file, it writes You some sentences.
There is also a version of one file (I use it on mobile phone).
And there is also a new HTML version, it may be more comfortable.
Most of people prefer buttons in browser over writing in console.
